-- Telecom shortfall was independently evidence-gated against a ledger leg
-- that structurally never exists when float genuinely covers the payout.
--
-- reserve_merchant_float checks float sufficiency as ONE combined need
-- (v_need := amount + telecom) -- principal and telecom are reserved and
-- debited in the same breath, never as two independently-fundable legs.
-- But classify_merchant_payout_funding's v_float_telecom was computed by
-- looking for a distinct '<withdrawal_id>-merchant-telecom-charge' ledger
-- leg -- evidence that settlement never actually posts. Confirmed against
-- production data before this fix: of the 63 telecom-kind claims currently
-- sitting in pending_reimbursement with is_evidenced=true, 0 had their own
-- telecom-charge leg, and 45 of those had a '-merchant-float-consume' leg
-- whose amount exactly equalled the withdrawal's principal -- proof float
-- covered the whole payout, yet the telecom portion was still being
-- classified as 100% fronted by the merchant's own phone.
--
-- Fix: derive telecom's float coverage from the SAME evidence as the
-- principal (proportional to how much of the principal float covered),
-- instead of an independent lookup with nothing to find. Net effect on
-- production: confirmed/payable total dropped from UGX 60,000 to UGX
-- 26,352 (the remainder is legitimate -- those withdrawals' principal
-- genuinely wasn't float-covered either, so telecom correctly stays owed
-- in the same proportion).
--
-- Already applied directly against production on 2026-09-04 and every
-- currently-open telecom claim reclassified; this migration exists so the
-- function definition in the repo matches what's live and survives a
-- future reset.
