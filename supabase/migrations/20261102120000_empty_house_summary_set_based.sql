-- Partner dashboard hero ("Amount needed to fund houses") loaded slowly.
--
-- empty_house_opportunity_summary() called house_has_live_claim(h.id) once per
-- eligible house (about 6,800 rows). That helper is a SECURITY DEFINER SQL
-- function, so Postgres cannot inline it and pays a full function call, with
-- three index probes, for every row. The same three EXISTS checks written
-- inline plan as ordinary sub-plans and run in a few tens of milliseconds.
--
-- Output is unchanged: same keys, same rules for "funded" (promissory-note
-- intent reserved/funded, partner self-support pending/active, company-managed
-- allocation reserved/fulfilled). CREATE OR REPLACE keeps the existing grants.
-- house_has_live_claim() itself is left in place for its other callers.
